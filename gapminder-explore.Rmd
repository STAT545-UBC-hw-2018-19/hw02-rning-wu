```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First, we load the `gapminder` and `tidyverse` packages: 

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

Next, we will "smell test" the data: 

Is it a data.frame, a matrix, a vector, a list?
```{r}
typeof(gapminder)
```

As we can see, `gapminder` is stored in a list. 

What is its class?

```{r}
class(gapminder)
```

`gapminder` belongs to the classes `tibble` and `data.frame`. 

How many variables/columns?
```{r}
head(gapminder)
```


How many rows/observations?
Can you get these facts about "extent" or "size" in more than one way? Can you imagine different functions being useful in different contexts?
What data type is each variable?
